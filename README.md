# Data-of-Cardiovascular-Medicine
 Clustering Analysis, Regressioin Analysis, and Classification Analysis 
 
Heart failure is a critical medical condition with a significant impact on patients' lives. This assignment explores predictive analytics in cardiovascular medicine using a dataset containing medical profiles of 299 patients who experienced heart failure. Students are tasked with clustering, regression, and classification to predict the 'DEATH_EVENT.'

Data Description: The dataset includes the medical profiles of 299 heart failure patients, with 13 clinical features, including age, sex, anemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium, smoking, and time, with the outcome variable 'DEATH_EVENT’. You can download the data from files section “heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset”.
